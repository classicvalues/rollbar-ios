# CHANGELOG

The change log has moved to this repo's [GitHub Releases Page](https://github.com/rollbar/rollbar-ios/releases).

## Release Notes Tagging Conventions

1.  Every entry within the PackageReleaseNotes element is expected to be started with
    at least one of the tags listed:

    feat:     A new feature
    fix:      A bug fix
    docs:     Documentation only changes
    style:    Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
    refactor: A code change that neither a bug fix nor a new feature
    perf:     A code change that improves performance
    test:     Adding or modifying unit test code
    chore:    Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation, etc.

2.  Every entry within the PackageReleaseNotes element is expected to be tagged with 
    EITHER 
    "resolve #GITHUB_ISSUE_NUMBER:" - meaning completely addresses the GitHub issue
    OR 
    "ref #GITHUB_ISSUE_NUMBER:" - meaning relevant to the GitHub issue
    depending on what is more appropriate in each case.

**1.0.0**

- Fix some threading issues
- Drop the alpha moniker

**1.0.0-alpha11**

- Framework builds for each of the recent versions of Xcode
- Cocoapods support

**1.0.0-alpha10**
- Change `setCaptureIp:` to `setCaptureIpType:`

**1.0.0-alpha9**
- Introduce the `CaptureIp` configuration setting. `CaptureIp` specifies the level of IP information
  to gather about the client along with items. This uses the enum `CaptureIpType` with the levels:
  `CaptureIpFull`, `CaptureIpAnonymize`, and `CaptureIpNone`.

  `CaptureIpFull` is the default behaviour which attempts to capture the IP address on the backend
  based on the IP address of the client used to POST the item.
  `CaptureIpAnonymize` will attempt to capture the IP address and semi-anonymize it by masking it
  the least significant bits.
  `CaptureIpNone` will turn off attempts to capture the IP address.


**0.2.0**
- Changes to better support bitcode in apps, ([pr#29](https://github.com/rollbar/rollbar-ios/pull/29)).
  - Add a version of PLCrashReporter compiled with bitcode support and a Rollbar prefix

- Add framework target for Carthage compatibility, ([pr#25](https://github.com/rollbar/rollbar-ios/pull/25))

**0.1.6**
- Handle localized bundle names, ([pr#24](https://github.com/rollbar/rollbar-ios/pull/24)).

**0.1.5**
- Fix compiler error when included in a Swift application, ([pr#16](https://github.com/rollbar/rollbar-ios/pull/16)).

**0.1.4**
- Fix crash where a `nil` message was passed to `buildPayloadBodyWithMessage`, ([pr#15](https://github.com/rollbar/rollbar-ios/pull/15)).

**0.1.3**
- Optionally enable/disable uncaught exception reporting, ([pr#8](https://github.com/rollbar/rollbar-ios/pull/8)).

**0.1.2**
- Rename reachability constant to fix linker error if you use [https://github.com/tonymillion/Reachability](https://github.com/tonymillion/Reachability) in your app.

**0.1.1**
- Fixed bug that would cause a crash on load if the internal file state somehow became corrupted.

**0.1.0**
- Added internet reachability monitoring so that items aren't attempted to be sent while the phone is not connected to the network.
- Removed log messages from release mode.

**0.0.4**
- Include bundle identifier in item payloads. This will be required for the symbolication process going forward, please update your dsym upload build phase script to the latest version seen [here](https://github.com/rollbar/rollbar-ios/tree/v0.0.4/upload_dsym.py).

**0.0.3**
- Configuration is now persisted so that crashes are reported with the proper person data on startup.
- New item saving and batching system with retries. Items are saved to disk first, while a separate thread monitors the disk for items to send. Queued items will periodically be batched together and sent by this thread, with failed attempts retried a few times in case of network reachability issues.

**0.0.2**
- Ability to set `person` data.

**0.0.1**
